I wonder if anyone else still uses Wireless@SGx, but anyway...

1. Go [here](http://pas.singtel.com/wsg_connect/index.php) to generate your username. I used my Singnet account, which is of the form `blahblah@singnet`. The username generated should be `blahblah|???????????????????????@singnet`.
2. Use the generated username as the username when connecting to Wireless@SGx. The password is the same password you use for Singnet. You can ignore all the other instructions about PEAP etc - those should come automatically on today's devices.
